DESCRIPTION
Vim offers built-in spell checking; when you enable it via 'spell' and
'spelllang', you can jump to the highlighted spelling errors in the buffer via
]s. With spelling errors scattered across a large document, Vim does not
provide an overview or report about the overall spell situation.

This plugin populates the quickfix-list with all spelling errors found in a
buffer to give you that overview. You can use the built-in quickfix features
to navigate to the first occurrence of a particular spell error. You can also
manage the spelling errors (mark as good / bad word, globally replace with
suggestion) directly from the quickfix window via the usual zg, zw, z=
etc. mappings.

A typical workflow (e.g. when composing email, commit messages, or any form of
documentation) includes writing and/or quitting the buffer, unless some
remaining spelling errors require further intervention. This plugin offers
auxiliary enhanced variants of :bdelete, :write and :quit that check for
spelling errors and only execute the action if none were found. So by using
these replacement commands, you'll never send or commit messages full of
embarrassing typos any more!

USAGE
:[range]SpellCheck[!]	Show all spelling errors as a quickfix list.
                        For multiple occurrences of the same error, the first
                        location and the number of occurrences is shown.
                        If [!] is not given the first error is jumped to.

                        In the quickfix list, spelling errors from other
                        buffers are kept, so you can use something like
                            :argdo SpellCheck
                        to gather the spelling errors from multiple buffers.

:[range]SpellLCheck[!]	Same as :SpellCheck, except the location list for the
                        current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

MAPPINGS
			Inside the quickfix window, the following mappings are
			remapped so that they operate on the target spell
			error: zg, zG, zw, zW, zug, zuG, zuw,
			zuW, z=, u
			For z=, all identical misspellings in the buffer are
			replaced with the chosen suggestion (via
			:spellrepall).
			You can also quickly undo the last spell suggestion
			from the quickfix window (i.e. without switching to
			the target buffer) via u.
			For the other commands, the taken action is appended
			to the quickfix list entry, so that the list serves as
			a record of done actions (until you refresh the list
			with a new :SpellCheck).

AUXILIARY COMMANDS
The following set of commands just issue an error when spelling errors exist
in the buffer or passed [range] of lines.
:BDeleteUnlessSpellError[!]     :bdelete the current buffer, unless it
                                contains spelling errors.
:WriteUnlessSpellError[!]       :write the current buffer, unless it
                                contains spelling errors.
:WriteDeleteUnlessSpellError[!] :write and :bdelete the current buffer,
                                unless it contains spelling errors.
:XitUnlessSpellError[!]         :write  the current buffer and :quit,
                                unless it contains spelling errors.

This set of commands automatically opens the quickfix list in case of spelling
error in the buffer or passed [range] of lines.
:BDeleteOrSpellCheck[!]         :bdelete the current buffer, or show the
                                spelling errors in the quickfix list.
:WriteOrSpellCheck[!]           :write the current buffer, or show the
                                spelling errors in the quickfix list.
:WriteDeleteOrSpellCheck[!]     :write and :bdelete the current buffer,
                                or show the spelling errors in the quickfix
                                list.
:XitOrSpellCheck[!]             :write the current buffer and :quit, or
                                show the spelling errors in the quickfix list.

:UpdateAndSpellCheck[!]         :update the current buffer, and show any
                                spelling errors in the quickfix list.

                                A [!] is passed to the :write / :bdelete /
                                :quit commands.
